# MIT Newsletter :computer:
An automated newsletter designed to generate e-mails from information on an excel document and send to emails to a list of subscribed people.

## Purpose
This project is created in the intent of having a semi-autonomous program that can use an html template slightly tweaked and turned into a .txt file. On a predefined date every month, the Python backend then accesses the given excel sheet, and places the appropriate data in predefined positions in the template. The edited .txt file can then be used as an HTML design, and sent using the *email* module.

## The Newsletter
The Newsletter, dubbed hyperlink, aims to improve technological awareness in our local school, by providing information for students to use in their everyday life.
We aim to:
* Suggest productivity apps that help students work more efficiently in school
* Provide tech tips that can help students experiencing basic issues but still not knowing how to deal with them
* Occasionally provide tech-related news in a legible and comprehensible manner
* Present forms and surveys that students wish to diffuse to the entire school, so that they can get more replies.

## About MIT
MIT (Masters in Technology) is a volunteer organisation in our school that aims to help those struggling with tech issues, and generally improve tech awareness through various projects. The Newsletter is one such project, and is one of our most ambitious yet, hoping to reach as many in the student body as possible.

*Please note that we are not endorsed by MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology) in any way or form. In fact, we own the institution. If you wish for free scolarships, please inform us and it shall be dispatched to you immediately.*
